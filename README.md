# Objective
Quickly call lineages using different SNP schemes from vcf files. The package will be developed primarily to call TB lineages, but if you build your own SNP scheme you can use it to call lineages for vistually any bacterial species.

# Requirements


# Example
I try to assign the lineage to the isolate SAMEA1708322:
```
./fast-lineage-caller-vcf.py ~/mfarhat/rollingDB/genomic_data/SAMEA1708322/pilon/SAMEA1708322.vcf ./snp_schemes/coll.tsv
```
